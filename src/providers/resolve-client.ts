/**
 * Runtime-layer entry point for capability client resolution.
 *
 * `resolveClient(capability, id, overrides?)` is the single surface
 * consumers use to obtain a typed client for a capability on a
 * provider. Lives under `src/providers/` so all provider dispatch —
 * registry lookup, OpenAI-compatible narrowing, transport override
 * construction, and the `MissingApiKey` → `ApiKeyMissingError` remap —
 * stays inside the runtime boundary. Consumer modules must not reach
 * into `./transports/` or `./registry.js` directly for the purpose of
 * resolving a client; they import `resolveClient` and hand off the
 * capability, provider id, and optional per-call overrides.
 *
 * No overrides → registry fast path: returns the pre-registered
 * client created at startup via `registerDefaultProviders()`.
 * Callers see `ProviderNotFound` if the registry was never
 * bootstrapped and `CapabilityNotSupported` if the provider exists
 * but lacks the requested capability.
 *
 * Overrides present AND provider is OpenAI-compatible AND capability
 * has a transport factory → bypass the registered static client and
 * construct a fresh one through the openai-compatible transport so
 * the caller's `baseURL` / `apiKey` reach the underlying SDK. Voyage
 * and `rerank` fall through to the registry fast path even when
 * overrides are supplied because neither is served by the
 * openai-compatible transport.
 *
 * Both paths funnel `MissingApiKey` through the same remap so the
 * surfaced error is `ApiKeyMissingError` regardless of code path.
