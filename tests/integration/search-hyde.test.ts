/**
 * Integration tests for HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) behavior.
 *
 * Verifies that enabling `hyde: true` actually changes the ranking pipeline
 * versus `hyde: false`. This is the regression test for the bug where HyDE
 * ran end-to-end but the additive heading/file boost combined with a narrow
 * candidate pool collapsed both code paths onto the same result set, making
 * `--hyde` a visual no-op.
 *
 * Two checks are performed against the same fixture corpus:
 *
 *  1. The top-k result list is not byte-identical between hyde:true and
 *     hyde:false. A pure no-op would produce two identical orderings.
 *  2. hydeOptions are forwarded through the spread without crashing or
 *     dropping fields.
 *
 * Requires OPENAI_API_KEY (real LLM + embedding calls). Skipped otherwise.
 * Local: `pnpm test:all` or `OPENAI_API_KEY=... pnpm test`.
